        <p>I'll tag along on your next trip to the crag and photograph you giving all you've got on the wall. I can go anywhere in the province of Québec and Ontario in Canada.</p>

        <h3>From up there</h3>
        <p>One way to capture your visit to the crag is to simply follow you while you climb on the wall. The goal isn't to do a dedicated photoshoot but to capture the action as it is happening. I won't stop or direct you during your climb, just do your thing and have fun. Definitely the way to go to have the most fun!</p>

        <h3>Craziest shots</h3>
        <p>To get the best photos, a dedicated photo shoot is needed. It doesn't have to be the whole day, but with some planning and preparation, I will guide you to get the perfect angle, body position and scenery.</p>
